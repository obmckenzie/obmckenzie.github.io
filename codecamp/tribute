						<p>Commonly called "Cassini", its mission was a collaboration between <a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a>, the <a href="http://www.esa.int/ESA">European Space Agency (ESA)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.asi.it/en">Italian Space Agency (ASI)</a>. The objective was to send a probe to study Saturn, including its rings and satellites. It was originally inteded to land on one of Saturn's moons but that plan was changed in order to no potentially contaminate the surface with potential stowaway microbes. Cassini is widely considered to be successful beyond expectation, even though it with Cassini entering a controlled burnup into Saturn.</div>

						<p>Cassini's original mission was planned to last for four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the Cassini Equinox Mission. The mission was extended a second and final time with the Cassini Solstice Mission, lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date Cassini was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere.</p>
						<p>The Huygens module traveled with Cassini until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; it was successfully landed by parachute on Titan on January 14, 2005. It successfully returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than our own. Cassini continued to study the Saturn system in the following years.</p>
						<p>At the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft executed the "Grand Finale" of its mission: a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings. The purpose of this phase was to maximize Cassini's scientific outcome before the spacecraft was destroyed. The atmospheric entry of Cassini effectively ended the mission.</p></div>
