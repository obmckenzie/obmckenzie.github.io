<h1> Hello, it's very good to have this opportunity to talk with you</h1>
<p> My name is Allison, and I've been in the web development and design world for a little more then 13 years. I'd like to tell you a little bit about why I think I'd be a perfect fit for this role and your company.</p>

<p> why should you call me back?</p>
<p> when I worked for Centernary College (University) I worked closely with departments to help find anf fulfil their needs for recruitement. This involved many conversations, with mockups, and a knowldge base to help me understand what they needed and point them in a direction that would fulfil their goals and work, while staying in the overall look and feel of the greater website.
<p>when I worked for lux I was the sole desginer for TO and I needed to work closely with a team of 4 to create function designs and mockups. Often we would have several mockups that we combine elements of to create a final version. That final version would then be taken to our outside developers where I would work closely with them to create that was desired. Occasionally, a desired function was not possible, it was then my job to return to the team with some potential solutions. This was usually done on a tight timeline. TO was on track to hit 6MM by the end of 2017.</p>
<p>At 00, I worked within AEM but also worked with LOBs and Developer to craft improvements to overall website functionality. I often was tracking several functionality changes are a time, and worked to keep both the LOB updated as well as my team.</p>
<p>personally, I really enjoy finding websites and reimagining them. This can range from a simple design change to a full functionality overhaul.</p>

<p>I think I would would be a great fit because I'm hightly proficient in HTML/CSS and have a strong understand of JS/jQuery functionality. I am proficient in Photoshop and illustrator, and have used them along with Sublime, Notepad++, and in browser tools to create mockups and preview potential edits. I've worked with several developer teams, and understand how to communicate changes/work in a manner that can be understood clearly. I'm highly motivated, and I while I'm on the East Coast I prefer to have a later start to the day.</p>p>
