	<h2>TargetOptical.com Eye Exam Flow</h2>
	<p>
  <a href="www.targetoptical.com/to-us/locations">Target Optial</a>'s eye exam flow is functional and does what it needs to do on a very basic level. Users can search for a location near them, they can find an exam at that location, they can get some very, very basic information like; location, store phone number, and store hours.</p>
  <p><b>Issue:</b> 
  <br><b>First</b>, there is a lot of wased space on the pages in the flow. While the can be a bonus, in this case it become too much white space. It leaves the user feeling a little empty, like there are parts of the site that are not loading. 
  <br><b>Second</b>, the amount of information that is given to the user is low. It doesn't give the user any confidence. Target is all about making their customers feel like they are in a comfortable space. 
  <br><b>Third</b>, it's very difficult to find an eye exam that works in "her schedule". As a user of the website, I don't care where my exam is, I care that it fits my schedule. Currently to look at the available times for a location the user must select a location, then select the day they want, then click the time arrows to see if the store has the time they want available. If it's not they must go back to step 1, with no guarantee that the other location will have that time either. 
  <br><b>Fourth</b>, the layout/graphics look a bit "dated" and are not current with the graphics used on the rest of the site.

	<div> <p>Current look of the flow</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Results feel short</li>
			<li>Unable to adjust width of search area, no indication of how big an area its searching</li>
			<li>Unable to filter results or indicate preferences (language, new patient, contact lens specialty, pediatrics, ect)</li>
			<li>Unable to see availability of exams, only if they are not allowing booking online</li>
			<li>Map is small, but takes up way to much of the page</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>New look of the flow, shrinking the whitespace opens the page for a slightly different layout. I kept the initial results to 3 but expanded the information that is displaying with them. Adjusted the map to be informative but less obtrusive. Brought the available eye exams to the first step, allowing users to find the important information right away. Also added ways to filter the results</p>

	<div>
		<img src="#">Image 2 - header cut
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Search field/Espot:<br> Condense the space for the search bar on the results page. There is too much white space and it takes up too much potential real estate. Adjust the ad espot so that it stretches to the end of the divider line. This gives a much more pleasant eye-line and doesn’t distract from the results below. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<img src="#">Filter Results
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Filter Search:<br> Added 3 basic filters are shown but can be expanded if the map is moved down to accomidate more ways to filter. The results below the filters will default to nearest location but based on the filter choices (if any) the results will adjust.
		<br>Exam Type: This would be a drop down menu with choices that would sort results. For example, if the user choose "new patient" only the doctors accepting new patients would display. Options appearing the the dropdown would be flexible and could be dictated based on business needs. For example; one of the options should be "urgent" and the results would then adjust to show only the doctors and appointment times available for urgent type appointments.
		<br>Patient wears contact lenses: This was spereated out because contact lens exams require more time. If a user clicks this box the exam times displayed for the doctors should adjust for the extended time allowed.
		<br>Distance: This shoud appear on any and all location searches. Users want to be able to dictate their search area. Some are okay travelling 50 miles for the time/item they want and for others anything more then 5 miles away is a hassle. 
		</p> 
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<img src="#">Doctor box
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>I call this the "Doctor Box". This box helps the user to feel like they are making an appointment with a person and gives them a sense of comfort. As this is a medical exam, you want the user to feel comfortable with their selection. 
		<br>Doctor Picture: If there is no picture then a filler image could be used but all doctors should be encouraged to add a headshot. Headshots allow uses to see who they are booking an appointment with, it gives a sense of comfort that isn't easily onveyed with just a name.
		<br>Doctor Review: Review Stars and the title from the best review should be displayed. The review section should link out to where the reviews are housed so that the user can view all of the reviews. Reviews allow booking with confidence.
		<br>Address & Link: Address should be small text and should give a general distance. The only link that should appear here is the link to the doctors website or store location's local page		</p>
