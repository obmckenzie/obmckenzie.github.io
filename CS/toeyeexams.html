	<h2>TargetOptical.com Eye Exam Flow</h2>
	<p>
  <a href="www.targetoptical.com/to-us/locations">Target Optial</a>'s eye exam flow is functional and does what it needs to do on a very basic level. Users can search for a location near them, they can find an exam at that location, they can get some very, very basic information like; location, store phone number, and store hours.</p>
  <p><b>Issue:</b> <br>First, there is a lot of wased space on the pages in the flow. While the can be a bonus, in this case it become too much white space. It leaves the user feeling a little empty, like there are parts of the site that are not loading. <br>Second, the amount of information that is given to the user is low. It doesn't give the user any confidence. Target is all about making their customers feel like they are in a comfortable space. <br>Third, it's very difficult to find an eye exam that works in "her schedule". As a user of the website, I don't care where my exam is, I care that it fits my schedule. Currently to look at the available times for a location the user must select a location, then select the day they want, then click the time arrows to see if the store has the time they want available. If it's not they must go back to step 1, with no guarantee that the other location will have that time either. <br>Fourth, the layout/graphics look a bit "dated" and are not current with the graphics used on the rest of the site.
